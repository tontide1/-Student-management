## Overview
Hello everyone üëãüèª, this is a small project (programmed by me [@tontide1](https://github.com/tontide1) ü§ì) on the topic of "student management" that almost anyone who has been studying computer science in Vietnam has to do through this project.
## Video
When running the program will look like this !

## Knowledge used
First, we need to declare the following libraries to use: <stdio.h>, <string.h>, <stdlib.h>.
In this small project, I only use basic knowledge when we learn programming like:
+ Loop (for, do while)
+ Switch case
+ condition (if else)
+ Function
+ Array
+ String
+ Struct 
+ Pass by reference (pointer)
## Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/tontide1/-Student-management.git
2. To be able to run the program you can run file **.exe** or you want to run, debug and edit code so you should download and install IDE:
    + [Dev C++](https://onboardcloud.dl.sourceforge.net/project/dev-cpp/Binaries/Dev-C%2B%2B%204.9.9.2/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe) ( Simple method )
    + [Visual Studio 2022](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/downloadVS.aspx?sku=community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Azure&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb&includeRecommended=true&cid=2030:df49cbf75b824b0fb722ccdd550df3e9) ( Simple method )
    + If you use [Vs code](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/704ed70d4fd1c6bd6342c436f1ede30d1cff4710/VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.77.3.exe) you can follow this [config Vs code for C/C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) ( A little difficult )
## End !
Thank you for your interest in this small project ! This small project is very helpful for beginners to learn programming.
If you like it, give me a star and a fork.
Love you, guys.
